At this time the following libraries are required under this folder:
- NeoNextion (https://github.com/atanisoft/NeoNextion)
- LocoNet2 (https://github.com/atanisoft/LocoNet2, from the development branch)

If you use git to clone this repository you can automatically pull the required
versions of the libraries via "git submodule init" from the DCCppESP32 cloned
repository, or via "git clone --recursive https://github.com/atanisoft/DCCppESP32.git"
which will clone all three in one command.
